According to Bugatti, the concept version of the Bolide is using the W16 engine with a weight-to-power-ratio of 0.91 kg/kW (0.67 kg/PS; 1.50 lb/hp). Bugatti Announced the Bolide would be the last car ever made with their W16 engine. The Bolide's name comes from the term le bolide, which literally means "the racing car" in French. The fundamental concept of the Bolide is based on a technical draft of Bugatti chief engineer and "Technical Guru" Frank Goetzke.Bugatti will build 40 Bolides in total, all priced around 4 million euros (about $4.7 million based on current exchange rates). The company says the Bolide "will be taken to production maturity" over the next couple of years, with the first deliveries scheduled for 2024.</p>

               <p id="op" class="text-muted text-left">The engines used in Bugatti models have a displacement of eight liters, as well as four camshafts and four turbochargers. Most high-performance models have just two turbochargers. Essentially, the quad turbo W16 engine is an amalgam of two VR8 engines sharing a common crankshaft and operating as one.The secret to the power of the Bugatti Veyron, Chiron, and Divo isn’t really a secret. Each model is equipped with a massive engine that features 16 cylinders, which are arranged in four banks in a unique W configuration. Since it first appeared under the hood of the Veyron in 2005, the W16 engine has been reconfigured several times, lending even greater horsepower and speed to Bugatti’s breathtaking line of supercars. Read on to learn more about the history of the W16 engine, as well as its future.THE W16 ENGINE IN BUGATTI SPORTS CARS
Currently, the street-legal Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+ houses the most powerful rendition of this engine. The Chiron Super Sport 300+ generates 1,578 hp and reaches a top speed of 304 mph, making it the fastest sports car in the world.

While the Chiron is the fastest model in the Bugatti lineup, it’s the limited-edition Centodieci that is the most powerful. The Centodieci also utilizes the W16 engine, but boasts 1,600 hp compared to 1,578 with the Chiron.

Even when it first debuted in 2005, the W16 was no slouch. Powered by the W16, the Veyron produced over 1,000 hp and raced to a top speed of 254 mph. At the time, the Veyron was the highest performing production sports car. Over time, the engine has been retuned to be stronger, faster, and better.

The most recent addition to the Bugatti lineup — Bugatti Divo — houses a W16 engine that produces 1,479 hp and 1,180 lb-ft of torque. Needless to say, the legendary W16 engine has come a long way since it took the auto world by storm over 15 years ago.</p>
